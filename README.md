# New-world
 beginning of my coding life

Hello everyone,happy to be here finally.
I'm on the road of being an interaction designer,and I want to code like a front-end engineer too(maybe a vocational one)
Tennis and classical music share the biggest parts of my enthusiasm.



Thanks and looking forward to growing up.
